# Flowbot

Flowbot is an academic Twitter bot: it reads RSS feeds from journals and preprint archives, selects papers based on keyword matching, and tweets them.

I ([@C_G_Thomson](https://twitter.com/C_G_Thomson)) adapted Flowbot to operate my [@chem_flow](https://twitter.com/chem_flow) twitter bot, which tweets papers about flow chemistry.

Flowbot was almost entirely cloned from PapersBot (https://github.com/fxcoudert/PapersBot) by (@fxcoudert) which is inspired by (and borrows some code from) [feedr](https://github.com/housed/feedr).
